Challenge Structure
This hackathon offers three deployment tracks. Each team should choose one track to focus on:

Amazon EKS Deployment Track
AWS Fargate Deployment Track
AWS Lambda Container Deployment Track
Common Requirements
Regardless of the track you choose, you will be working with the following common elements:

Microservices: You will be provided with two Node.js microservices - a Patient Service and an Appointment Service. The code for these services can be found in the Sample Microservices Code file.

Containerization: You need to containerize these microservices using Docker.

Infrastructure as Code (Terraform):

Set up a Terraform project structure supporting multiple environments (dev, staging, prod).
Provision the following AWS resources:
VPC with public and private subnets across two availability zones
IAM roles and security groups
S3 bucket for Terraform state storage
DynamoDB table for state locking
(Other resources specific to your chosen track)
Terraform State Management:

Implement remote state storage using S3
Set up state locking with DynamoDB
Configure workspace separation for different environments
GitHub Actions for IaC:

Create workflows for:
Terraform fmt and validate on all PRs
Terraform plan on pull requests
Terraform apply on merges to main branch
CI/CD: Implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for your application code.

Monitoring and Logging: Set up basic monitoring and logging using AWS CloudWatch.

Time Allocation
You will have 5 hours to complete this challenge. Budget your time wisely across planning, development, deployment, and documentation.

Evaluation Criteria
While specific criteria vary by track, you will generally be evaluated on:

Correct implementation of the chosen deployment platform
Quality and security of the IaC implementation
Effectiveness of the CI/CD pipeline
Containerization best practices
Monitoring and logging setup
Documentation quality
Overall architecture and security considerations
Proper implementation of Terraform state management and collaboration features
Getting Started
Review the common requirements and evaluation criteria.
Choose your deployment track: EKS, Fargate, or Lambda Container.
Follow the specific instructions for your chosen track.
Use the provided microservices code as a starting point for your application.
